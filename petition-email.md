Dear Jigang,

I am a senior student major in ECE. I am taking VE450 this semester. I am writing to you to discuss about the decision announced in class today about not allowing students to form own groups.

My main concerns include: 

1. Forming own groups has been going well and receiving higher evaluation in past years in both 450 and VG100.
2. Arranging students by preference may not benefit more than forming own groups even by its purpose.
3. Allowing students to form own groups actually meets with reality challenge more. 
4. Letting students to form own groups fit current pandemic better.

I am going to discuss them further in detail.

Since VG100, forming own groups is considered better among students. In undergraduate 2017, we have two sections not allowing students to form own groups while one allowing so. In our grade VG100 is still mainly about ME, not like following years, and there has been plenty of cases where unhappy experience in arranged groups causing students who were originally going to choose ME switched to ECE. In past several years VE450 allowed students to form own groups and actually, more and more VG100 sections in after years are allowing students to form own groups, or at least half of groups. On the other hand, **UM allow forming own groups in almost all courses**. As one of the oldest and best engineering schools in the world, I believe their choice has its reason. 

Arranging students by preferences aims to let students with similar preference to work together. However, nothing can fulfil this purpose more than just letting students form their own groups. Graduation project is the final project of every student’s undergraduate academic life, and is a general conclusion, presentation and performance of all that every students have learnt during four years in JI. **Letting students to form their ideal group can no doubt help them accomplish their best works and leave no regrets behind**. 

I do understand the purpose of arranging groups is to cultivate students’ ability to cooperate with people not familiar with. However, the ability to find companions is a more vital skill. Being able to really find people willing to cooperate with is even more prior to being able to work with people arranged. Graduation project is still an academic project, and as far as I am concerned, in academic life cooperation with selected people is a more common situation, while according to JI official website, over 80% of JI students continue on academic life after graduating from JI. Even in industry, one should first apply to company/department they prefer, and also get admitted, before they start to cooperate with other people. **Thus, one’s ability to first advertise oneself and find oneself group members is more prior in both academic and industry**. 

Many students are still abroad (leading to 12 hour time zone difference), in quarantine or expecting quarantine in the future ranging from 14 to 28 days depending on district. **Letting students to form own groups with people they prefer can help them overcome such tough situation better and minimise the affect of pandemic.**

Ancient Greece democracy has taught modern civilisations only arithmetic even is not fair.  Fairness is about allowing every individual to fully extent their potential capability, with only limit of other people’s identical right. The ability of finding group members is no doubt a key capability. Thus, allowing students to form own groups, though may have its own problems, is actually **more fair** than arranging random groups.

In general, I hope the decision of not allowing students to form own groups could have more room to discuss about, and I believe letting students to form their own groups fits everyone’s interest better.

I am looking forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,
